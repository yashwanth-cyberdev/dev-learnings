# Instructions for the Landing Page Assignment

## Overview
- There are 4 folders in this repository:
  - `landing-page-1`: Chai Aur Fitness Landing Page
  - `landing-page-2`: Chai Cohort - Learn to Code Landing Page
  - `landing-page-3`: ChaiPatti - Premium Tea Store Landing Page
  - `screenshots`: Screenshots of the above 3 landing pages

## What to do?
1. In each of the 3 folders (`landing-page-1`, `landing-page-2`, `landing-page-3`), you will find an `index.html` file and a `challenge.css` file.
2. Your task is to write the CSS code in the `challenge.css` file to style the `index.html` file so that it matches the design shown in the corresponding screenshot in the `screenshots` folder.

## Steps to Follow:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the unstyled version of the page.
2. Open the `challenge.css` file in your code editor.
3. Write the necessary CSS code in the `challenge.css` file to style the `index.html` file.
4. Save your changes and refresh the browser to see the updated styles.
5. Repeat the process until the `index.html` file looks like the screenshot in the `screenshots` folder.

## Tips:
- Use browser developer tools to inspect elements and test your CSS code.
- Break down the task into smaller parts and tackle one section at a time (e.g., navbar, hero section, features section).
- Ask for help if you get stuck, but try to solve the problem on your own first.

Good luck and have fun!
